# Code Quiz

## Description

For this project I was to build from scratch a quiz app in the browser taking advantage of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The reason for such an idea is to test myself on my own ability to answer code related questions as well as lock in the skills needed to get the app to function correctly. In making this app I ran into a a variety of different JavaScript methods and functions I was very new to and it took a lot of processing to get it working the way I wanted. There is quite a few features I'd have liked to add and a few strange behaviours to fix. This challenge pushed me a lot :)

## Installation

No installation steps needed

## Usage

To correctly use this app the user only has to read the start text to understand the rules and from there they press Start! After that a series of questions will appear and after answering them all or running out of time a score will display as well as a field to enter their initials. After that they are directed to a highscore page with the ability to retry or clear the highscores.
